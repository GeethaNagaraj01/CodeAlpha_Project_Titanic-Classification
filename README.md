# 🚢 Titanic Classification - CodeAlpha Data Science Internship

## 🎯 Aim
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts titanic passengers' survival by age, sex, passenger class, and port of embarkation features. The model aims to state the key factors that have affected survival outcome or that might predict survival accurately via classification algorithms.

## 📁 Data
- **Source**: Given by CodeAlpha / Based on Kaggle's Titanic dataset
- **Columns Used**:
  - `Survived` – Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  - `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`
  
---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

---

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Read the CSV dataset
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns
3. **Preprocessing**: Encode categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
4. **Model Building**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy score, classification report, confusion matrix
6. **Visualization**: Plots for survival by gender and age distribution

## 📊 Results
| Model              | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression |  **XX%** |
| Random Forest       |  **YY%** |

> *Replace XX and YY with your actual results after running the code*.
